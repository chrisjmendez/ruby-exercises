# Simple CSV Parser

The purpose of this app is to demonstrate how we can parse a Comma Separated Value into a Dictionary. In Ruby lang, Dictionary is also referred to as a Hash. This technique of mixing your Column Header with a Row value is helpful when you're dealing with 40k records that each have more than 5 columns.  It just becomes easier to manage the data.


We use the ```excelsior``` gem because it's much more efficient at parsing Comma Separated Values then a method like readline.  


# Getting Started

I decided to make this app more Object Oriented so on a Mac, go to ```Applications/Utilities/Terminal```, install 
```
ruby init.rb
```
