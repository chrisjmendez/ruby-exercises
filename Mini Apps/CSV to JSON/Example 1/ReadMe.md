# CSV to JSON

This is an example of how you can convert a CSV file to JSON using gem ```excelsior```. Another neat trick is how to translate SMPTE time code into seconds using monkey patching.


## Data Files

Input Files

- The original file is in **XLS**
- The **CSV** file is how we'll parse the data

Output
- **JSON** is the final ouput
