# Ruby Apps


* CSV Parser - This app uses Ruby gem ```excelsior``` to parse a CSV file with over 42k rows into a Dictionary.  This is the lightning fast approach to parsing.

* CSV to JSON - This app shows how to convert a CSV fie into JSON.  Example 1 uses the Ruby gem```excelsior```. Example 2 uses the default ```csv```.

* Food Finder - This app shows how to make a Kiosk-type application. 

* Nginx Error Log Parser - This app will parse and sort an Nginx Log to count errors.

* Reporting - I was given about 1000 records with timezones.  The data is supposed to represent where users are located when they log on.  My job is to iterate through each record and organize it into a report that's easy to read.  

* XML to JSON - The first script create an XML file filled with fake user info.
